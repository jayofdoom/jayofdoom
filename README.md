About Jay
=========

I am Jay Faulkner, an Open Source Developer and Advocate. I believe that
through working with others around the world to solve problems we can make
the world better. Open source is a great way to do that.

My current employer, the
[G-Research Open Source Software team](https://github.com/G-Research), believes
that and enables me to work on open source software to help ensure that the
open source ecosystems they rely on remain healthy long term.

Projects I Work On
==================

Ironic
------
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org), primarily written in Python, is a cloud
computing platform. I've been working on [Ironic](https://ironicbaremetal.org),
a component that plugs into OpenStack -- or can be used standalone -- to
provision real, physical hardware as easily as one can provision VMs. I
currently serve as a member of the OpenStack Technical Committee and as
Project Team Lead for OpenStack Ironic.

I've been a working on Ironic since the icehouse cycle (2014), and have been
active in code review and development of the project since then. Ironic remains
a primary part of my daily work and representing approximately 4/5 of my full
time focus.

Ironic is an incredibly impressive piece of software, and I'm very proud of
how far it's come in the years I've worked on it. It'll be fun to see where
the future leads.

Armada
------
[Armada](https://armadaproject.io) is a kubernetes batch meta-scheduler
currently in the CNCF sandbox. It's used at extreme scale to schedule and
manage jobs across multiple kubernetes clusters.

I have only recently begun working on Armada, and have been focusing primarily
on continuous integration, client code, and developer outreach. I spent
approximately 1/5 of my full time job contributing to Armada.

Armada has opened the door to a separate cloud world altogether -- CNCF and
kubernetes. It's been interesting to see some of the similarities and
differences between the tooling and community around it compared to OpenStack.

Gentoo
------
[Gentoo](https://gentoo.org) is a highly customizable linux distribution that
focuses on building the system from source. Gentoo linux is the tool I used to
learn about open source and linux, and I've used it off and on for over 15
years. Now, it's the primary OS on most computers I run.

I do Gentoo on my own time, cleaning up and helping proxy-maintain ebuilds
across the main Gentoo repo and a handful of overlays. I'm also a regular
presence on several Gentoo-related channels on IRC. Come find me there as
nickname JayF or JasonF. I hope to ramp up my contribution to Gentoo and
remain a long-term presence in the community.

Working with Gentoo has enabled me to make small contributions to a myriad of
open source projects -- mostly minor build fixes. I always enjoy working with
Gentoo because of the many different ideas, packages, and systems you can run
up against when trying to solve problems.
