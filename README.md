About Jay
=========

I am Jay Faulkner, an Open Source Developer and Advocate. I believe that
through working with others around the world to solve problems we can make
the world better. Open source is a great way to do that.

My current employer, the
[G-Research Open Source Software team](https://opensource.gresearch.com), believes
that and enables me to work on open source software to help ensure that the
open source ecosystems they rely on remain healthy long term.

Content Creation
================

Podcast
-------
As part of my current job, I get to host the [GR-OSS OUT Podcast](https://podcast.gr-oss.io).
I enjoy highlighting the struggles that everyone has -- senior or junior -- and how to overcome
them. It's a nice side effect that I get to meet many of my fellow open source developers and
hear about the journey they've gone on.

YouTube
-------
Also as part of my current job, I get to spend some of my time creating video content around
Ironic and other open source projects I've worked on on the
[GR-OSS Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@oss-gr) In a world where physical conferencegoing
is in decline, I appreciate being able to put conference-quality content out on Youtube for
anyone to see from their own home or office.


OSS Projects
============

Ironic
------
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org), primarily written in Python, is a cloud
computing platform. I've been working on [Ironic](https://ironicbaremetal.org),
a component that plugs into OpenStack -- or can be used standalone -- to
provision real, physical hardware as easily as one can provision VMs. Ironic
also serves as the backend that powers [CNCF Metal3](https://metal3.io). I am
currently a core contributor in OpenStack Ironic.

I also serve as a member of the
[OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team](https://security.openstack.org/vmt.html),
where I help triage and evaluate incoming security bugs for applicable OpenStack
projects.

I've been a working on Ironic since the icehouse cycle (2014), and have been
active in code review and development of the project since then. Ironic remains
a primary part of my daily work. In previous years, I've served
as PTL of Ironic and as a member of the Technical Committee -- including one
term as TC chair.

Ironic is an incredibly impressive piece of software, and I'm very proud of
how far it's come in the years I've worked on it. It'll be fun to see where
the future leads.

Gentoo
------
[Gentoo](https://gentoo.org) is a highly customizable linux distribution that
focuses on building the system from source. Gentoo linux is the tool I used to
learn about open source and linux, and I've used it off and on for over 15
years. Now, it's the primary OS on most computers I run.

I am a [Gentoo developer](https://packages.gentoo.org/maintainer/jayf@gentoo.org)
on my own time, cleaning up and helping maintain ebuilds across the main Gentoo
repo and a handful of overlays. I'm also a regular presence on several
Gentoo-related channels on IRC. Come find me there as nickname JayF or
JasonF.

Working with Gentoo has enabled me to make small contributions to a myriad of
open source projects -- mostly minor build fixes. I always enjoy working with
Gentoo because of the many different ideas, packages, and systems you can run
up against when trying to solve problems.
